<h1> JavaScript and DOM Manipulation</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new repository for this project called javascript-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.</li>


<li>Clone the new repository to your computer.</li>


<li>Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2.</li>


<li>Add your html files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.</li>


<li>Push the above changes to GitHub.</li>


</ol>

<h1>Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search </h1>
<ul>
 <li> <Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).</li>


<li>Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.</li>

<li>Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.</li>



<li>Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input<li>

</ul>
